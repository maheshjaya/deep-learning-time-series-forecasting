This repository contains the implementation and experimental results for the manuscript:

"A Comparative Study on Deep Learning Models for Time-Series Forecasting"

The study compares four deep learning architectures:
- LSTM
- GRU
- CNN
- Transformer

The models are evaluated on two univariate time-series datasets:
1. Apple (AAPL) stock prices
2. Melbourne daily minimum temperature dataset
